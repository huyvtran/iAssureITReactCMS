============================

Next Plan

1) Create eCommerce Website Using CMS
   So blocks would be made of two things
    - One type of block will be made from CMS
    - Second Type of Blocks would be made from eCommerce Engine


2) Using SSR, we have to ensure our page is 100% SEO ready. This is the most critical work. Must be done. 


3) Master Skeleton to be created fro each type of page. for example, Services. 
   Once this master page is created, blocks are added, then we should always use this skeleton to 
   create this Services Type page. We should not do the same task of adding blocks every time. 

   Using this master page skeleton, we will create 6 types of Services pages as given in below menu. 
   We will also create hundreds of Portfolio pages, using similar page layout.
